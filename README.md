# ROS 2 AGV Navigation

A ROS 2 Humble workspace for developing an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) navigation stack.  
The project will integrate:

- **Odometry estimation** ✅ *(in progress)*
- **Motion control** ✅ *(in progress)*
- **SLAM for mapping** ⏳ *(planned)*
- **Nav2 for autonomous navigation** ⏳ *(planned)*

---

## 📍 Current Status
Development has started with **odometry and control**.  
Once the odometry module is stable, work will continue on SLAM integration and Nav2 path planning.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **ROS 2 Humble**
- **Python / C++**
- **Gazebo** (for simulation)
- **RViz** (for visualization)

---

## 📅 Roadmap
1. Odometry implementation  
2. Differential drive motion control  
3. SLAM integration (cartographer / slam_toolbox)  
4. Nav2 stack setup for autonomous navigation  
5. Testing on real/simulated AGV hardware
